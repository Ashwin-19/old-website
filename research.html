	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>I started my research journey in ethnography, learning about qualitative methods to understand social phenomenon. I like to apply them in understanding how users configure their identity online, interact with other users and indulge in online disclosures. My research helps inform the design of social media and other computer-mediated communication technologies. </p>

	<p>Recently, I have become more interested in social computing - particularly leveraging social media data {temporal, content, network} and using computational methods to understand user or community level behaviours online. I prefer to work on research problems that have social implications. </p>

	<p>My identity uniquely positions me to investigate the intersection of these research problems with marginality (particularly on the basis of caste, gender and sexuality). I deeply care about making these systems {social media + computer-mediated communication technologies} more inclusive and less harmful for the margins of society. </p>
